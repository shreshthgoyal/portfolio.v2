Who wouldn’t want instant answers from their documents? That’s exactly what RAG chatbots do—combining retrieval with AI generation for quick, accurate responses!

In this guide, I’ll show you how to create a chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with [**LangChain**](https://www.langchain.com/) and [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/). This chatbot will pull relevant information from a knowledge base and use a language model to generate responses.

I’ll walk you through each step, providing multiple options for response generation, whether you use **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**, **[Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/)**, or **[Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/)**—ensuring a flexible and cost-effective solution.

## What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**RAG** is a method that combines **retrieval** and **generation** to deliver more accurate and context-aware chatbot responses. The retrieval process pulls relevant documents from a knowledge base, while the generation process uses a language model to create a coherent response based on the retrieved content. This ensures your chatbot can answer questions using the most recent data, even if the language model itself hasn’t been specifically trained on that information.

Imagine you have a personal assistant who doesn’t always know the answer to your questions. So, when you ask a question, they look through books and find relevant information (retrieval), then they summarize that information and tell it back to you in their own words (generation). This is essentially how RAG works, combining the best of both worlds.

In a Flowchart RAG process will somewhat look like this:

Now, let’s get started, and get our own chatbot!

## Setting Up the Project Environment

> We'll be using Python mostly in this TUTO, if you are JS head you can follow the explanations and go through the documentation of [langchain js.](https://js.langchain.com/docs/introduction/)

First, we need to set up our project environment. This includes creating a project directory, installing dependencies, and setting up API keys for different language models.

### 1. Create a Project Folder and Virtual Environment

Start by creating a project folder and a virtual environment:

```bash
mkdir rag-chatbot
cd rag-chatbot
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next, create a `requirements.txt` file to list all necessary dependencies:

```txt
langchain==0.0.329
streamlit==1.27.2
faiss-cpu==1.7.4
python-dotenv==1.0.0
tiktoken==0.5.1
openai==0.27.10
gemini==0.3.1
fireworks==0.4.0
sentence_transformers==2.2.2
```

Now, install these dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setting Up API Keys

We’ll be using **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or **Fireworks** for the chatbot’s response generation. You can choose any of these based on your preferences.

> Don't worry if you are experimenting, Fireworks provide $1 worth of API keys for free, and `gemini-1.5-flash` model is also free to an extent!

Set up a `.env` file to store the API keys for your preferred model:

```txt
# Uncomment your API key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
# FIREWORKS_API_KEY=your_fireworks_api_key_here
```

Make sure to sign up for these services and get your API keys. Both **Gemini** and **Fireworks** offer free tiers, while **OpenAI** charges based on usage.

## Document Processing and Chunking

To give the chatbot context, we’ll need to process documents and split them into manageable chunks. This is important because large texts need to be broken down for embedding and indexing.

### 1. Create `document_processor.py`

Create a new Python script called `document_processor.py` to handle document processing:

```python
from langchain.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter

class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def load_and_split(self):
        loader = TextLoader(self.file_path)
        documents = loader.load()
        splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)
        texts = splitter.split_documents(documents)
        return texts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processor = DocumentProcessor("data/sample_text.txt")
    texts = processor.load_and_split()
    print(f"Processed {len(texts)} text chunks")
```

This script loads a text file and splits it into smaller chunks of about 1000 characters with a small overlap to ensure that no context is lost between chunks. Once processed, the documents are ready to be embedded and indexed.

---

## Creating Embeddings and Indexing

Now that we have our documents chunked, the next step is to convert them into **embeddings** (numerical representations of text) and index them for fast retrieval. (as machines understand numbers easier than words)

### 1. Create `embedding_indexer.py`

Create another script called `embedding_indexer.py`:

```python
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

class EmbeddingIndexer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

    def create_vectorstore(self, texts):
        vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(texts, self.embeddings)
        return vectorstore

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from document_processor import DocumentProcessor

    processor = DocumentProcessor("data/sample_text.txt")
    texts = processor.load_and_split()

    indexer = EmbeddingIndexer()
    vectorstore = indexer.create_vectorstore(texts)
    print("Vector store created successfully")
```

In this script, the embeddings are created using a [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models) model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). We then store these embeddings in a **[FAISS](https://faiss.ai/)** vectorstore, which allows us to quickly retrieve similar text chunks based on a query.

---

## Implementing Retrieval and Response Generation

Here comes the exciting part: combining retrieval with language generation! You’ll now create a **RAG chain** that fetches relevant chunks from the vectorstore and generates a response using a language model. (vectorstore is a database where we stored our data converted to numbers as vectors)

### 1. Create `rag_chain.py`

Let’s create the file `rag_chain.py`:

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI, Gemini, Fireworks
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

load_dotenv()

class RAGChain:
    def __init__(self, vectorstore):
        self.vectorstore = vectorstore
        self.llm = self.get_llm()

    def get_llm(self):
        if os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"):
            return OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), temperature=0)
        elif os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"):
            return Gemini(api_key=os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY"), temperature=0)
        elif os.getenv("FIREWORKS_API_KEY"):
            return Fireworks(api_key=os.getenv("FIREWORKS_API_KEY"), temperature=0)
        else:
            raise ValueError("No valid API key found! Please set one in .env file.")

    def create_chain(self):
        retriever = self.vectorstore.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 3})
        qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
            llm=self.llm,
            chain_type="stuff",
            retriever=retriever,
            return_source_documents=True
        )
        return qa_chain

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from document_processor import DocumentProcessor
    from embedding_indexer import EmbeddingIndexer

    processor = DocumentProcessor("data/sample_text.txt")
    texts = processor.load_and_split()

    indexer = EmbeddingIndexer()
    vectorstore = indexer.create_vectorstore(texts)

    rag_chain = RAGChain(vectorstore)
    qa_chain = rag_chain.create_chain()

    query = "What is the capital of France?"
    result = qa_chain({"query": query})
    print(f"Answer: {result['result']}")
```

Here, we give you the choice between **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or **Fireworks** based on the API key you provide. The RAG chain will retrieve the top 3 most relevant documents and use the language model to generate a response.

You can switch between models depending on your budget or usage preferences—**Gemini** and **Fireworks** are free, while **OpenAI** charges based on usage.

## Building the Chatbot Interface

Now, we’ll build a simple chatbot interface to take user input and generate responses using our RAG chain.

### 1. Create `chatbot.py`

Create a new file called `chatbot.py`:

```python
class Chatbot:
    def __init__(self, qa_chain):
        self.qa_chain = qa_chain

    def get_response(self, user_input):
        try:
            response = self.qa_chain({"query": user_input})
            return response['result']
        except Exception as e:
            return f"An error occurred: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from rag_chain import RAGChain
    from document_processor import DocumentProcessor
    from embedding_indexer import EmbeddingIndexer

    processor = DocumentProcessor("data/sample_text.txt")
    texts = processor.load_and_split()

    indexer = EmbeddingIndexer()
    vectorstore = indexer.create_vectorstore(texts)

    rag_chain = RAGChain(vectorstore)
    qa_chain = rag_chain.create_chain()

    chatbot = Chatbot(qa_chain)

    while True:
        user_input = input("You: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ['exit', 'quit', 'bye']:
            print("Chatbot: Goodbye!")
            break
        response = chatbot.get_response(user_input)
        print(f"Chatbot: {response}")
```

This script creates a command-line chatbot interface that continuously listens for user input, processes it through the RAG chain, and returns the generated response.

---

## Creating the Streamlit UI

It’s time to make your chatbot even more user-friendly by building a web interface using **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**. This will allow users to interact with your chatbot through a browser.

### 1. Create `app.py`

Create `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
from document_processor import DocumentProcessor
from embedding_indexer import EmbeddingIndexer
from rag_chain import RAGChain
from chatbot import Chatbot

@st.cache_resource
def initialize_chatbot(file_path):
    processor = DocumentProcessor(file_path)
    texts = processor.load_and_split()
    indexer = EmbeddingIndexer()
    vectorstore = indexer.create_vectorstore(texts)
    rag_chain = RAGChain(vectorstore)
    return Chatbot(rag_chain.create_chain())

st.title("RAG Chatbot")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a text file for the knowledge base", type="txt")

if uploaded_file:
    with open("temp_knowledge_base.txt", "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())

    chatbot = initialize_chatbot("temp_knowledge_base.txt")

    if "messages" not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.messages = []

    for message in st.session_state.messages:
        st.chat_message(message["role"]).markdown(message["content"])

    if prompt := st.chat_input("Ask a question"):
        st.chat_message("user").markdown(prompt)
        st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})

        response = chatbot.get_response(prompt)
        st.chat_message("assistant").markdown(response)
        st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})
else:
    st.write("Please upload a text file to start chatting!")
```

### 2. Run the Streamlit App

To run your Streamlit app, simply use:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a web interface where you can upload a text file, ask questions, and receive answers from the chatbot.

## Optimizing Performance

For better performance, you can experiment with chunk size and overlap when splitting the text. Larger chunks provide more context, but smaller chunks may make retrieval faster. You can also use **[Streamlit caching](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/advanced-features/caching)** to avoid repeating expensive operations like generating embeddings.

If you want to optimize costs, you can switch between **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, or **Fireworks** depending on the query complexity—use **OpenAI** for complex questions and **Gemini** or **Fireworks** for simpler ones to reduce costs.
